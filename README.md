The left panel consists of two parts:
1. Top-right half of the graph is a correlation matrix (blue = -1, red = +1) 
2. Bottom-left half is a signifficance matrix.

The right panel graph is a scatter plot for a selected cell in the correlation matrix. Green box shows the bounds of abnormal data. When selected, red - is abnormal, orange - is normal data.
